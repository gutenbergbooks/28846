<h2>LITTLE JACK RABBIT'S<br />ADVENTURES</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE RAILROAD</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was a wild story that came to the ears of
Little Jack Rabbit for, as he came hopping
down the Shady Forest Path, a whole troop
of his playmates ran out to meet him, and
one cried one thing, and one another, but
the words which he heard most plainly
were:</div>

<p>"The railroad! The railroad! Oh, have
you heard?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Little Jack Rabbit, not
at all excited, "I know a railroad is going
to run past the Sunny Meadow."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's nothing! It's going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
run right through your house!" cried Busy
Beaver.</p>

<p>"Right through the Old Bramble
Patch!" shouted Chippy Chipmunk.</p>

<p>"Right through your front door!"
screamed Gray Squirrel.</p>

<p>"I don't believe that," said Little Jack
Rabbit. "A railroad can't get through a
door!"</p>

<p>"Why, of course they'll take out the
door," replied Busy Beaver; "they'll pull
down your whole house; they'll clear away
the Old Bramble Patch; why, they may use
the whole of the Sunny Meadow&mdash;every bit
of it!"</p>

<p>By this time Little Jack Rabbit was excited.
Already he saw the dear Old Bramble
Patch torn out by the roots; the little
house gone, and himself and all the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
forced to rove homeless through the Shady
Forest. So it was no wonder he almost forgot
to stop at the postoffice on his way home.</p>

<p>But as he came up the Shady Forest Path
that afternoon, he saw that the dear Old
Bramble Patch was still there&mdash;that was
one comfort. No wandering about tonight,
at least.</p>

<p>And there, too, was his little brother,
Bobby Tail, turning somersaults under the
Old Chestnut Tree, and Mr. and Mrs. John
Rabbit sitting quietly on the front doorstep.</p>

<p>So Little Jack Rabbit plucked up heart
and asked Papa Rabbit if the railroad were
going to take away the Old Bramble Patch
and their house.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," replied Mr. Rabbit, "but
it's coming mighty close."</p>

<p>"I just knew it wasn't," said Little Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Rabbit with a sigh of relief. "But Busy
Beaver said it was and that I must pack up
my clothes at once."</p>

<p>"Well, the line was laid out to run right
through the dear Old Bramble Patch," said
Mr. Rabbit, "but when they found it must
cross the Old Duck Pond, they turned it to
one side. So the dear Old Bramble Patch
is safe."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIRST TRAIN</h2>

<div class='poem'>
Look out for the Choo-choo cars!<br />
Don't you hear the thunder jars?<br />
First the whistle, then the bell<br />
Clanging through the Forest Dell.<br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">For</span> weeks and weeks there was great excitement
among the Little People of the
Shady Forest and Sunny Meadow. From
behind trees and bushes, rocks and stumps,
they watched the building of the railroad.</div>

<p>Professor Jim Crow came to offer advice,
but changed his mind. As for Little Jack
Rabbit, he looked out from behind a stump
and wondered.</p>

<p>Cousin Cotton Tail had been forced to
move from the Big Brush Heap on the hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
She and her little bunnies were now visiting
in the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>When Little Jack Rabbit was told that
a railroad must be level, he thought a man
would come with a big scythe and slice off
the top of the hill like a loaf of bread and
lay the slices in the hollows.</p>

<p>This wasn't so very strange, seeing that
he was only a little bunny boy and, of
course, didn't know anything about building
railroads.</p>

<p>Every day the railroad came nearer being
finished. The hill was dug out. As
Mr. Mole remarked, "It was done almost
as well as I could have done it, only, of
course, I would have made a tunnel."</p>

<p>Then the sleepers were laid. Busy
Beaver smiled as he watched the men lay
the great logs on the smooth earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't they be dandy for my dam?"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"You've got all you need," answered
Little Jack Rabbit. "I'm glad they didn't
break up the Old Rail Fence and make railroad
ties out of it."</p>

<p>Finally the rails were fastened on the
logs and the railroad was finished; the first
train was to run through and everybody
was waiting to see it.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. John Rabbit put on their
Sunday clothes and took Little Jack Rabbit
and Brother Bobby Tail to the end of the
Old Rail Fence.</p>

<p>Pretty soon a black speck appeared at
the end of the long line. It grew bigger
and bigger. A cloud of smoke arose and
drifted over to the Shady Forest. There
was a rattle and a roar and a din. Little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Jack Rabbit hid behind his mother's skirt,
but the train had already passed them.</p>

<p>And there on the platform of the last car,
stood the Farmer's Boy, holding on by the
door, bowing and smiling and proud as a
king.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h2>A NARROW ESCAPE</h2>

<div class='poem'>
Hear the engine whistle toot!<br />
See the smoke and smell the soot!<br />
Lucky that the train don't stay,<br />
But flashes by and far away!<br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">At</span> first the Grown-ups in the Shady Forest
and the Sunny Meadow were very sorry to
have the railroad come so near, but after a
while they found it didn't matter so much;
for the cars passed through a "cut" so deep
that the engine's smokestack hardly reached
the top, and you only knew they were there
by the sound.</div>

<p>Of course, it took Cousin Cotton Tail
ever and ever so long to get used to the Old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Bramble Patch. You see, it wasn't anything
like the Old Brush Heap, with its
covering of trailing vines, and she was glad
when she was able to go back to her old
home on the other side of the Bubbling
Brook.</p>

<p>On this side the Sunny Meadow was just
the same; so was the Shady Forest, and by
and by everybody almost forgot that there
had been a time when there wasn't any railroad.</p>

<p>At the Old Barnyard, however, things
were very different, for the railroad made
a turn just there and came in very close
to the Big Red Barn.</p>

<p>Cocky Doodle had all he could do to
keep the Barnyard Folk out of danger.
Every morning after his early cock-a-doodle-do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
he read them a lesson on the dangers
of crossing railroad tracks.</p>

<p>For a while Henny Penny laid her eggs
in the Henhouse. The truth was that her
nest in the corner of the Old Rail Fence
happened to be just at the end of the Sunny
Meadow where the railroad ran through
the "cut," and the noise of the cars made
her nervous.</p>

<p>Ducky Waddles was glad that the Old
Duck Pond was still safe. He had heard
how it had just escaped being bridged over
for the noisy cars.</p>

<p>Yes, everyone kept away from the railroad
track except Goosey Lucy. And why
Goosey Lucy liked to waddle down the
steep bank and along the hard wooden logs
of the roadbed no one could find out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>But one fine day Goosey Lucy got caught.
Yes, sir. Before she could get off the track
the train came along. It was very narrow
between the two steep banks, and she
couldn't fly high enough to reach the top.
Cocky Doodle and Henny Penny shut their
eyes. They couldn't bear to see what was
going to happen.</p>

<p>But Goosey Lucy wasn't such a goose,
after all. She sat perfectly still between the
rails, and when the train had passed over
her, she got up, shook the cinders off her
white feathers and waddled back to the Old
Barnyard!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>SCHOOL</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Come</span>, get your cap, I'm going to take you
to school today!"</div>

<p>Little Jack Rabbit was too surprised to
answer&mdash;he just opened his mouth, and the
only sound his mother heard was a funny
little noise like a whistle.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear me?" she asked, tying
the strings of her Sunday bonnet under her
furry chin.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said the little rabbit at last recovering
from his surprise. "Why do you
want me to go to school?"</p>

<p>"Because all the Shady Forest grown-ups
think it's a good thing to have a school for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the children," and she gave her bonnet a
push and pulled on her black silk mitts.</p>

<p>"Get your cap. Every mother will be
there for the opening day, and we mustn't
be late."</p>

<p>The little rabbit hopped silently along
by his mother's side, wondering how it had
all happened so suddenly. He hadn't heard
a word about a school, nor had any of his
playmates.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" he
asked at last.</p>

<p>"Because we didn't want Grandmother
Magpie to know anything until the matter
was settled," answered Mrs. Rabbit in a
low voice. "She is such a busy-body."</p>

<p>Goodness me! Mrs. Rabbit had hardly
finished speaking when up flew the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
person she had been talking about. Yes,
there she stood, right on the Shady Forest
Path a few feet in front of them.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Grandmother
Magpie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack Rabbit gave her bonnet strings
a jerk. She always did this when she was
angry, and the sight of that disagreeable
bird reminded her of the time she had told
tales on Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Good morning," answered the little rabbit's
mother stiffly. She didn't really want
to say good morning, but she had to be
polite.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Grandmother
Magpie, hopping along by Mrs.
Rabbit's side. Mrs. Rabbit said nothing,
only hopped along faster, but she couldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
get rid of that mischievous old bird. Oh,
my, no. She stuck around like a chestnut
burr.</p>

<p>"Grandmother Magpie," said Mrs. Rabbit
at last, "I have some important business
to attend to this morning, so I will say
goodby." And she gave Grandmother Mischief,
as she was often called, such a stiff
bow that the old lady magpie stopped short
and let them go on without her.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2>A MISTAKE IN SPELLING</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Shady Forest School had once been a
pigeon house, but when the farm was sold
and the old buildings torn down, it had been
left to shelter Mr. and Mrs. Pigeon, who
wouldn't move away.</div>

<p>One night during a great storm it had
toppled off the post on which it stood, and
rolled down the hillside, helped along by
Billy Breeze, until it had landed on the
edge of the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>Here it had been discovered by the Little
Forest Folk, and at Parson Owl's suggestion,
had been pushed and shoved in and
out among the trees until it stood right-side
up in a sunlit clearing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Parson Owl had called together all
the Grown-ups and persuaded them to
make it into a schoolhouse.</p>

<p>And, well, here we are with Mrs. Rabbit
and her little bunny on their way to the
opening exercises, so there is no need of
saying anything more about it, except that
it had a nice door in front and a dozen
round holes, under which were fastened
little pieces of board for wide windowsills,
on which the pigeons used to stand and
preen their feathers.</p>

<p>As Little Jack Rabbit and his mother
drew near they saw Chippy Chipmunk's
face at one of the little round windows.
Then Busy Beaver looked out of another,
and pretty soon every little round window
had a head peeping through, while in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
doorway stood Professor Jim Crow in his
black swallowtail coat.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Rabbit," he said,
looking over his spectacles. "You have
brought another scholar, I see."</p>

<p>When they were seated in the schoolroom,
he walked over to the big blackboard.</p>

<p>"John," he said, turning to the little rabbit,
"tell me how to spell your name."</p>

<p>Goodness gracious me! Would you
believe it, the little rabbit answered
"J-A-C-K!" You see, he was so used to
being called just "Jack" that he spelt
"John" the same way.</p>

<p>Then Professor Jim Crow asked who was
the first President, but he didn't enquire
who was going to be the next, for I guess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he thought the little rabbit hadn't studied
Politics enough. After that he told Mrs.
Rabbit that she had a very bright little
bunny boy even if he didn't know how to
spell his right name.</p>

<h2>DISOBEDIENT JIMMY CROW</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Professor Jim Crow</span> and his family lived
in the Tall Pine Tree.</div>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Crow," he said to his wife
one morning, "as I shall be away almost all
day teaching the Little People of the Shady
Forest and the Sunny Meadow to read and
write, you will have your hands full with
the children. Be very careful, my dear,
for they haven't yet learned to fly!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry," answered Mrs. Crow,
"you have troubles enough with the schoolhouse
full of children. I'll take good care
that ours come to no harm."</p>

<p>Professor Jim Crow had been gone only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
few minutes when who should call but
Grandmother Magpie.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she said, perching on
a branch near at hand so as to look into
the nestful of little crows.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadfully busy," answered Mrs.
Crow. "Now that the Professor is teaching
school, I have all the care of the children.
It's no easy matter, for each little
crow thinks he knows how to fly."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps he does!" said Grandmother
Magpie. "If you don't let them
try how are they ever going to learn?"</p>

<p>"They are not old enough," replied Mrs.
Crow.</p>

<p>"Not old enough?" repeated that meddlesome
old lady bird. "Stuff and nonsense!
Of course they are!" Then off she
flew, leaving Mrs. Crow dreadfully upset<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and the little crows very discontented.</p>

<p>After making sure that Grandmother
Magpie was out of sight, Mrs. Crow flew
over to the Sunny Meadow for worms for
her hungry children, but first she told them
to be careful not to fall out of the nest while
she was gone.</p>

<p>"Botheration!" said little Jimmy Crow
after a few minutes. "Every word Grandmother
Magpie says is true. We are kept
like prisoners in this old nest. I'm going
to fly!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" cried all his brothers and sisters.
"You can't fly even across the Shady
Forest Path."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I can walk," said the
naughty little crow, and he hopped out of
the nest and fluttered down to the ground.</p>

<p>But, Oh dear me! Just then along came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Farmer's Boy. In a twinkling, he
caught poor Jimmy Crow and cut off the
tips of his wing feathers with a big jack-knife.</p>

<p>"Now, my little black beauty, you won't
fly far," he laughed, and turned his steps
toward the Old Farm.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"So, you're caught, Jimmy Crow!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sang gay Billy Breeze,</span><br />

<h2>A PRISONER</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Pretty</span> soon along came Little Jack Rabbit
on his way home from school. Everybody
in the Shady Forest knew Little Jack Rabbit.
From his nest in the Tall Pine Tree
Jimmy Crow had often seen him hopping
by with the Squirrel Brothers.</div>

<p>How he wished now he had never left
the dear old nest. Here he was, a prisoner,
and there was the little rabbit, free and
happy, hopping home from school.</p>

<p>He tried to flutter out of the Farmer
Boy's hand, but he was only held the tighter,
so he lay perfectly still and wondered
miserably what his mother would say when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
she came home and heard that he had disobeyed.</p>

<p>By and by the Farmer's Boy opened the
gate to the Farmyard and walked over to
the Big Red Barn. Pretty soon he found
an old birdcage, in which he put poor
Jimmy Crow. Then he hung it up on the
little front porch of the Old Farm House.</p>

<p>"What have you got there," asked the
Kind Farmer when he came home for supper,
"a young crow?"</p>

<p>"Yep," answered the Farmer's Boy. "I
picked him up in the woods; he was tryin'
to fly."</p>

<p>It was very lonely on the little front
porch after Mr. Merry Sun had gone to
bed. Jimmy Crow huddled in one corner
and watched Mrs. Moon climb over the
hilltop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>He heard Granddaddy Bullfrog singing
in the Duck Pond, and the splash of the
millwheel as it turned slowly over and over.
How he wished he had obeyed his mother
and was safe at home, listening to his father
tell the school news, and who was late, and
who knew his lesson best.</p>

<p>By and by the Old Grandfather Clock in
the Farm House struck ten and the lights
went out. If it hadn't been for Mrs. Moon
it would have been pitch dark.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he heard a familiar hoot, and
the next minute dear Old Parson Owl fluttered
up to the cage.</p>

<p>It didn't take him long to find the handle
on the little door, which he opened softly.</p>

<p>"Jump out!" he whispered. "Hop after
me as fast as you can. I'll fly low down so
you won't lose sight of me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I dreaming?" thought the poor
little crow, as he fluttered down to the
ground and hopped after Old Parson Owl
toward the Shady Forest. "If I am, I hope
I'll wake up in Mother's nest!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<h2>HOME AGAIN</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was very late when they reached the Tall
Pine Tree. The good Professor was sound
asleep after a hard day's work in the Shady
Forest Schoolhouse and a long search for
his little lost crow. He had hunted for him
until it grew so dark that he had been
forced to give it up.</div>

<p>But Mrs. Crow was wide awake and the
little crows were crying softly over their
little lost brother. Disobedience makes
others unhappy as well as the one who disobeys.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Mrs. Crow heard the
gentle flap of wings, and looking over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
edge of the nest, she saw Old Parson Owl
in the dim moonlight. The next moment
the sight of little Jimmy Crow hopping
after him made her heart go pitter-patter.</p>

<p>"Here's our little boy!" she cried, fluttering
down to the ground, while all the little
crow brothers and sisters looked over the
edge of the nest, and Professor Jim Crow
woke up with a start.</p>

<p>But, dear me! Didn't they have a dreadful
time getting the little crow up in the
tree. You see, he could only flutter now
that his wings had been clipped, and if Old
Parson Owl hadn't carried him on his
broad back, I doubt if Jimmy Crow ever
would have reached the nest.</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Moon had crossed
over the sky, and Mr. Merry Sun was getting
out of bed in the gold and purple East.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The Shady Forest was beginning to
awake. The birds were chirping to one
another, and the Little Four-footed People
were racing up and down the trees and
scampering over the ground.</p>

<p>Parson Owl waited to see that everything
was all right, and then, turning to
Professor Jim Crow, said:</p>

<p>"If Little Jack Rabbit hadn't come to
tell me that the Farmer's Boy had stolen
Jimmy Crow, your little son would still
be in the cage on the farmhouse porch."</p>

<p>"My dear Parson," said Professor Jim
Crow gratefully, "I shall never forget what
you and Little Jack Rabbit have done."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," said the kind old
Parson, hurrying back to the Big Oak Tree
before the light grew too strong for his big
round eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
Oh, children, never disobey,<br />
And never break a rule,<br />
And never tell what is untrue,<br />
Nor run away from school.<br />
</div>

<p>Perhaps if all the little boys and girls
who read this story will learn this verse, it
will keep them out of trouble. If Jimmy
Crow had, maybe he never would have disobeyed
his mother.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE STOLEN EGGS</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Mr. Merry Sun</span> was up bright and early.
He shone on the Sunny Meadow and
lighted up the dark places in the Shady
Forest.</div>

<p>He even poked a sunbeam in the eye of
Parson Owl, who winked and blinked and
turned the other way.</p>

<p>Soon everybody was wide awake, for the
Little People of the Shady Forest and the
Sunny Meadow are always up with Mr.
Merry Sun.</p>

<p>Little Jack Rabbit, looking out of the
Old Bramble Patch, wondered who was
bending over the tall grass in the corner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the Old Rail Fence. Shading his eyes with
his right paw, he looked again. Yes, it was
the Farmer's Boy. Pretty soon he stood up
straight, holding his hat carefully in his
hand. Then he turned with a whistle and
walked home.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he's been up to?"
thought Little Jack Rabbit, and, being a
curious little bunny, he hopped over to find
out. Carefully peeping through the tall
grass he saw a nice round nest, but it was
empty. Only a gray speckled feather was
left.</p>

<p>"He's stolen the eggs!" cried the little
rabbit. "He's just mean enough to steal
eggs!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="326" height="500" alt="&quot;Did You Steal My Eggs?&quot; Cried Henny Penny." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Did You Steal My Eggs?&quot; Cried Henny Penny.<br /><i>Little Jack Rabbit's Adventures.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <i>Page 43</i><br />
</span>
</div>






<p>Just then Henny Penny came across the
Sunny Meadow. She was a very pretty
gray speckled hen and lived in a little house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
by the Big Red Barn. But instead of laying
her nice white eggs in the comfortable
nests in the Henhouse, she came all the
way over to the Old Rail Fence Corner.</p>

<p>But Little Jack Rabbit didn't know that.
He didn't know whose nest it was until
Henny Penny cried distractedly, "Who has
stolen my eggs? Did you, Little Jack Rabbit?"</p>

<p>"Is it your nest?" he gasped, so startled
that he asked a question instead of answering
one.</p>

<p>"Of course it's mine," replied Henny
Penny, looking at him as if she meant to
peck his little pink eyes right out of his
head. "But answer my question. Did you
take my eggs?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said the little rabbit.
"I saw the hired boy leave here a few minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ago with his hat in his hands. Maybe
he took them."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Cock-a-doodle-do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What can I do for you?"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>asked a beautiful big rooster, all of a sudden,
just like that.</div>

<p>"O Cocky Doodle!" cried Henny Penny,
"my nest has been robbed. Let's tell the
Kind Farmer that the hired boy has stolen
my eggs."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<h2>AT THE FARM</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">All</span> right, come along," said Cocky Doodle,
and he started back for the Old Farm,
followed by Henny Penny and the little
bunny.</div>

<p>"Where are you going?" called out Mrs.
Rabbit from the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>"I'm going over to the Old Farm with
Henny Penny and Cocky Doodle," answered
her little bunny boy.</p>

<p>"You'd better be careful," said his
mother, "the farmer might catch you."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Mrs. Rabbit," said
Cocky Doodle; "he's a very kind farmer."
Mrs. Rabbit smiled, as if she only half believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the little rooster. Then she turned
to her little rabbit boy and said, "Keep a
bright lookout, and don't forget you're only
a small bunny."</p>

<p>After that away went the three little people,
Cocky Doodle, with his bright red
comb, and Henny Penny in her pretty gray
speckled feathers, and Little Jack Rabbit,
in his fur waistcoat, white as the big clouds
that chased Mr. Merry Sun over the bright
blue sky.</p>

<p>"Who is this little bunny?" asked Turkey
Tim when they all came to the Farm Yard.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" answered Henny
Penny. "Why, he's the little rabbit who
colors the Easter Eggs!"</p>

<p>"What!" cried a big fat goose.</p>

<p>"This is Little Jack Rabbit," said Cocky
Doodle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you," said Goosey Lucy.
"Do you paint goose eggs, too?" But before
the little bunny could say yes or no, the
Kind Farmer himself came out of the
house.</p>

<p>"Why, look who's here," he said with
a smile. And such a kind smile that
Little Jack Rabbit wasn't the least bit
afraid.</p>

<p>"He saw the hired boy steal the eggs
from my nest in the corner of the Old Rail
Fence," cried Henny Penny.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the Kind Farmer.
"So that's where you've been laying your
eggs, is it, Miss Henny Penny?"</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Cock-a-doodle-do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She only laid a few.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But after this she'll lay the rest</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Within the little wooden nest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You hung upon the Henhouse wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And tell you with her cackle-call,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said the little rooster, for Henny Penny was
too ashamed to speak.</div>

<p>Then the Weathercock whirled around
on his big toe and, pointing at the little hen,
shouted through his tin megaphone:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Why don't you stay at home and lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And not go calling every day?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I never leave my perch up here</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No matter what the atmosphere."</span><br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<h2>COLORED EGGS</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">I often</span> wondered why she went across
the Sunny Meadow every day," said Ducky
Waddles. "It's too long a walk for me!"</div>

<p>"Yes, you wabble too much!" said Henny
Penny.</p>

<p>"That's because I've little thin pieces of
skin between my toes," answered Ducky
Waddles. "My feet are too wide and flat
for walking, but they make splendid paddles."</p>

<p>"Come, come," interrupted the Kind
Farmer. "Henny Penny hasn't explained
why she goes over to the Sunny Meadow
to lay her eggs instead of in the nice nests
in the Henhouse."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I wanted Little Jack Rabbit
to color them for Easter," she answered.
"I thought if I laid them near the Old
Bramble Patch it would be easier for
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the reason?" said the Kind
Farmer. "And pray, Mr. Jack Rabbit,
how do you color the eggs?"</p>

<p>Oh, dear me! Wasn't the little rabbit
embarrassed! He wasn't sure but what he'd
better hop back to the Old Bramble Patch.
Perhaps, too, he was a little bit afraid of
the big Kind Farmer.</p>

<p>"I never colored any eggs," answered the
little rabbit in a low voice, "but I've often
helped mother color them. She takes a big
red rose and rubs it over an egg until it
turns red. With a buttercup she makes a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
yellow one. From the violets by the Bubbling
Brook she gets a beautiful purple
color, and from the wild roses a lovely pink
tint. Just every-day grass gives a dandy
green color."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," laughed the big Kind Farmer,
"so that's what the rabbits do on Easter, is
it?" and he turned away and went into the
Big Red Barn to feed the horses.</p>

<p>"I guess it's time for me to be going,"
said Little Jack Rabbit. "Mother may
worry if I stay away too long!"</p>

<p>"What's your hurry?" said Ducky Waddles.</p>

<p>"Goodby," said Henny Penny.</p>

<p>"Come again," said Cocky Doodle.</p>

<p>"Come very soon," said Turkey Tim.</p>

<p>"Call tomorrow," cried Goosey Lucy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>But the little rabbit was out of hearing by
this time, and just as Mr. Merry Sun went
down behind the West Hill, he hopped into
the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>"Come, wash your hands; supper is
ready," said Mrs. Rabbit, as she took the
carrot muffins out of the oven and dished
the stewed lollypops.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>HENNY PENNY'S MISTAKE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> was great excitement at the Old
Barn Yard. A big mistake had been made.
Whose fault it was no one could tell; but
the fact was that Henny Penny had hatched
out a brood of ducklings.</div>

<p>At first nobody thought anything was
wrong, except that, perhaps, her little brood
had very large bills and feet, much larger
than those of any little chicks at the farm.</p>

<p>But one day when the whole brood waddled
off down to the Old Duck Pond and
jumped in everybody knew that Henny
Penny had little ducks and not little
chickens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor little Henny Penny! She stood
upon the bank and clucked and clucked to
them to come back.</p>

<p>"You'll be drowned, my darlings!" she
cried. But the little ducks threw out their
great brown feet as cleverly as if they had
taken swimming lessons all their lives and
sailed off on the Old Duck Pond, away,
away among the ferns, under the pink
azaleas, through reeds and rushes and arrowheads
and pickerel weed, the happiest
ducks that ever were born. And soon they
were quite out of sight.</p>

<p>Poor little Henny Penny. She didn't
know how to swim, so she sat down on the
bank and waited for her little ducks to come
back. Now and then she wiped her eyes on
her downy breast feathers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't cry," said Cocky Doodle kindly.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said Rosy Comb. "Your
children seem to know how to swim as well
as Ducky Waddles."</p>

<p>Just then across the Old Duck Pond came
a chorus of quacks, and at a distance was
seen the little brood swimming home, their
feathers gleaming in green and gold.</p>

<p>"Such a splendid time we've had," they
all cried as they waddled up the bank.
"And we know now how to get our
own living, for there are lots of little fish
and flies out there on the Old Duck Pond.
We can take care of ourselves, so don't
worry any more about us, Mother Henny
Penny."</p>

<p>"They are little ducks, not chickens,"
said Ducky Waddles.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Henny Penny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
tearfully, wiping her eyes with a tiny yellow
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," replied Ducky Waddles.
"Don't I know a duck's foot when
I see it?"</p>

<p>"Dear, Oh dear!" sighed the poor little
hen, "there has been a dreadful mistake!"</p>

<p>But whose mistake it was no one could
tell, for the Kind Farmer never confessed
that he put duck eggs in Henny Penny's
nest.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE DAM</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Bubbling Brook was slowly drying
up. Everyone on the Sunny Meadow was
worried, and the little people who lived
in the water were even more worried.</div>

<p>It was just like having one's house pulled
down while living in it. You see, as the
water became more shallow there were
places in the little brook that were hardly
covered with water, and it was only in the
deep holes that the fish and crabs could
swim at all.</p>

<p>And the cause of all this was Busy
Beaver. Yes, sir. Busy Beaver was building
a dam across the Bubbling Brook.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Somehow he knew that winter was coming,
when it would be all frozen over. But
he knew that if he built a dam across it, a
little pond would form where the water
would be too deep to freeze clear down to
the bottom.</p>

<p>"I'll leave a little opening in the dam to
let the water run out when it gets high
enough," said Busy Beaver to himself as
he laid mud and stones on top of a log.</p>

<p>If the Little People of the Sunny
Meadow had only heard him they wouldn't
have been so worried. Little Jack Rabbit
did, though, as he came hopping down the
Shady Forest Path.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said the little bunny.</p>

<p>Busy Beaver looked up from his work.
He had almost finished a mighty good job.
First, he had cut down a tree, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sawed it with his sharp teeth into logs.
These he had rolled into the water, weighting
them down with stones and mud until
gradually he had built up a splendid dam
from the bottom of the pond.</p>

<p>"It's almost finished," said Busy Beaver.
"It took me quite a long time, for sometimes
the logs would bob up and drift away,
and I'd have to begin all over again. But
I kept at it, and now I've got a nice dam
to hold back the water."</p>

<p>"Why do you want deep water?" asked
the little rabbit.</p>

<p>"Come over here and I'll show you," answered
Busy Beaver, leading Little Jack
Rabbit around to the end of the dam nearest
the Shady Forest. "There, you see my
house. Now the water must be deep enough
so that when it freezes my front door will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
always be below the ice. Otherwise I
wouldn't be able to swim in and out."</p>

<p>"How soon will the Bubbling Brook start
running again?" asked the little bunny.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon&mdash;maybe tonight," answered
Busy Beaver.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! I'll tell my friend the little
Fresh Water Crab!" and away hopped the
little rabbit to the Sunny Meadow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2>GOOD NEWS</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Already</span> the water was beginning to trickle
over the pebbly bottom of the Bubbling
Brook.</div>

<p>All of a sudden a voice overhead shouted,
"Good morning!" and there sat Chatterbox,
the Red Squirrel, in the Big Walnut Tree.
"Why are you in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"I must tell all my friends in the Sunny
Meadow the good news," replied the little
rabbit. "I can't wait a minute."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Chatterbox, running
down the tree. "Tell me, what's the
news?"</p>

<p>"The Bubbling Brook will be running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
again tonight," answered the little bunny,
and he explained all about Busy Beaver's
dam.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," exclaimed Chatterbox,
"Busy Beaver has a lot of nerve to stop the
water running in the Bubbling Brook. He
doesn't own the water rights. The Bubbling
Brook belongs to everyone alike."</p>

<p>"So it does," answered Little Jack Rabbit,
"but Busy Beaver has to look out for himself.
If he doesn't build a dam his little
house will be frozen up this winter."</p>

<p>Just then the water rose almost to the
ferns that grew on the edge of the Bubbling
Brook. "Everything's all right now," said
the little rabbit, "I won't bother to go over
to the Sunny Meadow. The fishes and the
little fresh water crabs will learn the news<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
before I can get there," and he sat down
to talk things over with Chatterbox.</p>

<p>"You just ought to see Busy Beaver use
his tail as a trowel to lay on the mud," said
the little rabbit, who couldn't keep from
talking about what he had just seen. "He
carries the mud and stones between his chin
and forepaws and knows just how to put
them in the cracks between the logs to keep
back the water."</p>

<p>"Well, we all must prepare for the long,
cold winter," said Chatterbox. "Brother
Tip Top and I have been gathering nuts for
many a day and have our storehouse nearly
full."</p>

<div class='poem'>
While the Autumn days are here<br />
Make things snug for Winter drear;<br />
Storehouse filled with everything<br />
To last until again it's Spring.<br />

<h2>A PERPLEXED LITTLE RABBIT</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Goodness</span> gracious me!" exclaimed Little
Jack Rabbit, all of a sudden, "the Clover
Patch is all dried up. What shall I do
when winter comes?"</div>

<p>"Hunt for old turnips and carrots in the
field," laughed Chatterbox.</p>

<p>"I think I'll leave you," answered Little
Jack Rabbit thoughtfully, "I'm beginning
to worry about what's going to happen
to me," and away he hopped, leaving the
little red squirrel sitting beneath his tree.</p>

<p>"'Most everybody I know," thought the
little rabbit as he hopped along, "curls up
and goes to sleep for the winter. I wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
if I could? I'm going home to ask
Mother."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Rabbit was too busy putting up
carrot jelly to answer questions. "Don't
bother me," she said, "I haven't got a minute
to spare." So the only thing for the little
bunny to do was to go to somebody else.</p>

<p>The very first person he met was Hedgy
Hedgehog. He was just coming out of his
hole, which he had been busily lining with
grass and dry leaves, some of which were
still sticking to his spikes, for he hadn't
had time to brush himself.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked the little
bunny.</p>

<p>"Getting ready for winter. I've fixed up
my place nice and warm, and when the cold
weather comes I'll creep in and sleep till
Spring."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you eat?" asked Little Jack
Rabbit, who could eat all the time, and
sometimes oftener, like all rabbits.</p>

<p>"Don't eat&mdash;can't eat when you're asleep,
you know."</p>

<p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed the little
bunny, "that would never do for me!" and
he hopped away.</p>

<p>By and by he came to the Old Duck Pond.
There sat Granddaddy Bullfrog on a log,
winking and blinking in the light of Mr.
Merry Sun.</p>

<p>"Granddaddy Bullfrog, what do you do
when winter comes?"</p>

<p>"Why, bless you, my little bunny,"
answered the old gentleman frog, "I go
to sleep in the mud at the bottom of
the pond."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I can't do that!" sighed the
little rabbit.</p>

<p>"Of course not," laughed Granddaddy
Bullfrog. "Do what your mother says, and
stop worrying!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE TURNIP</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, I guess Granddaddy Bullfrog is
right," thought Little Jack Rabbit, as he
hopped back home to the Old Bramble
Patch. "What's the use of worrying about
winter? I'll take Granddaddy Bullfrog's
advice and leave it all to Mother."</div>

<p>After that he felt much better. Pretty
soon he saw Timmy Meadowmouse looking
out of his little round house of grass, no
larger than a cricket ball, which was fastened
to three or four stiff stalks of grass
about a foot above the ground.</p>

<p>"Good morning. Do you know, I've
been dreadfully worried about winter; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
now I'm going to take Granddaddy Bullfrog's
advice and leave it all to mother."</p>

<p>You see, this little rabbit just couldn't
stop talking about his troubles, although he
was going to leave them all to mother!</p>

<p>"There! She's waving to you from the
Old Bramble Patch," cried Timmy Meadowmouse.
Away went the little bunny
without another word and in less than five
hundred hops he was home.</p>

<p>"Hop over to the field and bring me a
turnip. Your father will be home for lunch
in a few minutes," said Mrs. Rabbit.</p>

<p>Little Jack Rabbit hopped through the
Old Rail Fence, across the road and into
the field where the Old Scarecrow flapped
his arms every time Billy Breeze whistled
through the cornstalks. But the Old
Clothes Man couldn't frighten the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
bunny. Oh, my no! It took more than that,
although he was a scary little chap. You
see, he knew all about the Old Scarecrow,
for he had watched the Kind Farmer put
him up in the early Spring.</p>

<p>Picking up a nice looking turnip, he
turned about and started back again. But,
Oh dear me! All of a sudden out from behind
a cornstack jumped the Farmer's Boy.</p>

<p>The little rabbit didn't stop to say sorry
to have met you. No siree. He hopped
away as fast as he could, but not fast enough.
Before he had gone maybe thirteen hops a
stone hit his left hind leg.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" yelled the Farmer's Boy.
"Wait till I hit you again, Mr. Cottontail."
But he didn't, for the little rabbit went
faster on three legs than he had on four, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the next minute popped safely into the dear
Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>"Where's the turnip?" asked Mrs. Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Goodness me! I guess that's what the
Farmer's Boy hit me with," answered the
little bunny.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BONFIRE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> in the Shady Forest was having
a dreadful time. Old Parson Owl was
nearly coughing his head off, Professor
Jim Crow's voice was so hoarse his scholars
could hardly understand him, and Little
Jack Rabbit's eyes looked as if he had been
crying for a week.</div>

<p>The reason for all this was that the smoke
from the Farmer Boy's big bonfire had
drifted into the forest until every chink and
corner was filled.</p>

<p>At first no one knew what was the matter.
Of course the air smelled queer and made
one's eyes smart. But after a while when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the smoke grew so thick that it seemed like
night-time and Mr. Merry Sun couldn't
be seen at all, the Forest Folk thought it
time to hold a meeting to consider what was
best to do. They all decided to ask Billy
Breeze to help them, and you can imagine
how grateful they were when he agreed to
blow the smoke out of the Shady Forest.
Before Mr. Merry Sun went down behind
the hills that night Billy Breeze had cleared
the smoke away and everything was clean
and sweet again.</p>

<p>Now, before all this had taken place, a
handful of burning leaves had drifted
along the Old Rail Fence, setting fire to the
long, dry grass, and in a short time there
was quite a fire close to the Old Bramble
Patch.</p>

<p>It didn't take Little Jack Rabbit long to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
borrow some sweet potatoes from his
mother, and while he was roasting them
Chippy Chipmunk climbed through the
fence with a bagful of chestnuts.</p>

<p>Pretty soon along came Jimmy Crow,
and when he saw what was going on, he
was mighty anxious to have some fun, too.
So off he went to get some bittersweet berries,
for he likes them much better than
sweet potatoes.</p>

<p>After a while Mrs. Rabbit came out to
see whether they were up to any mischief.
She was worried for fear they might burn
up the Old Rail Fence or set fire to the Old
Bramble Patch. But no, nothing was
wrong. All three were quietly sitting
around a small fire, the little rabbit peeling
a hot sweet potato, the little chipmunk shelling
a smoking hot chestnut and the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
crow picking out the nice browned bittersweet
berries.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed the lady rabbit
with a sigh of relief, "I expected to see the
Old Rail Fence in ashes and the dear Old
Bramble Patch in flames."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h2>MRS. COW</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Ting-a-ling!</span> ting-a-ling!" went Mrs.
Cow's bell. Mrs. Cow seemed mighty anxious
to get away from somebody. Yes, sir!
she kept right on running, although every
now and then she'd turn her head to look
behind her.</div>

<p>By and by Little Jack Rabbit came hopping
over the top of the hill with a tin pail
in his paw. But, goodness me! Mrs. Cow
didn't have to run away from him. No
indeed. He wasn't going to milk her. He
didn't have a milk pail at all, but a little dinner
pail, and Mrs. Cow was mistaken and
had run away for nothing.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rabbit was going berrying down in the
Cranberry Marsh on the other side of the
Old Duck Pond, but of course Mrs. Cow
didn't know that.</p>

<p>But she did know it wasn't time to be
milked, and, anyway, she wasn't going to
have anybody milk her but the Kind
Farmer.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cow! Mrs. Cow!" cried the little
rabbit, "I'm going cranberrying, not milking.
Don't run away!"</p>

<p>"Honest Injun?" said Mrs. Cow, halting
at the Bubbling Brook. "Cross your
heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, cross my heart," answered the little
rabbit.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so," replied
Mrs. Cow. "I might have sprained my
ankle jumping over the Bubbling Brook."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Then she trotted along by the little rabbit's
side.</p>

<p>"How's your Ma these days?" she asked
in a little while.</p>

<p>"She's going to make cranberry jelly
when I get back," replied the little rabbit.
"Father's very fond of it. How's Mr.
Bull?"</p>

<p>"He's very well," answered Mrs. Cow.
"He was up when Cocky Doodle sang his
Sun Song this morning."</p>

<p>"So was I," laughed the little rabbit.
"Mother says Cocky Doodle is better than
an alarm clock, for you don't have to wind
him."</p>

<p>Just then they came to the end of the
meadow, so the little rabbit hopped through
the fence and down to the Cranberry Patch
to fill his pail with the bright red berries.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SUGAR-COATED CARROT</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">All</span> of a sudden, just like that, he saw something
shining in the grass. And what do
you think it was? You'll never guess, so
I'll tell you right away. A sugar-coated
carrot. But before he could put it in his
pocket along came little Katie Cottontail,
swinging her sunbonnet in her paw.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Wiggle your ear and shut your eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Twinkle your nose and say 'Oh my!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>shouted Little Jack Rabbit, "and I'll give
you something to make you laugh."</div>

<p>"What is it?" asked little Katie Cottontail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but just the same she didn't wait for an
answer, but closed her eyes and twinkled
her nose up and down, and then sideways.</p>

<p>But, Oh dear me. Just then the little
rabbit dropped the sugar-coated carrot and
couldn't find it. He hunted high and low,
and so did little Katie Cottontail, but the
candy carrot was gone. Yes, sir. It certainly
was. And I'll tell you where it went.
Into a little hole in the ground where a
snake had his home.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll make some cranberry juice
soda when we get home," said Little Jack
Rabbit, and off they hopped to the Cranberry
Patch. In a little while he had filled
his pail and Katie Cottontail her apron, and
then they started for home.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 326px;">

<span class="caption">Katie Cottontail Went Clippety-Clap Up the Path.<br /><i>Little Jack Rabbit's Adventures</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Page 81</i><br /></span>
</div>




<p>"I must be careful not to squash 'em, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Mother'll give me a scolding," she said, as
they climbed up the bank where the railroad
track cut through. But, Oh dear me!
Just as they were about to hop through the
Old Rail Fence, along came a train.</p>

<p>"Ding, dong!" went the bell. "Toot-toot-toot!"
shrieked the whistle. Poor little
Katie Cottontail gave a shiver and dropped
her apron. Then clipperty-clip, lipperty-lip
she went up the Cow Path to the
Old Brush Heap on the hillside.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cow looked up and, seeing the little
bunny girl hopping home all out of breath,
thought something must be the matter and
ran back to the Big Red Barn. The bell on
her collar didn't make nearly as much noise
as the one on the locomotive, but it made her
hurry, just the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goodness me! What scary things girls
are!" said the little rabbit. "Mrs. Cow's
ten times as big as Katie Cottontail, but she's
just as scary."</p>

<p>After picking up the cranberries which
the little frightened girl rabbit had spilled
from her apron, the bunny boy hopped
home to the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>His mother was standing in the kitchen
doorway, her right paw shading her eyes as
she looked anxiously over the Sunny
Meadow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2>BAD LUCK</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Goodness</span> me! I'm dreadfully worried,"
cried Mrs. Rabbit, "I just saw the Kind
Farmer's Black Cat cross the path from
right to left, and that means bad luck, you
know."</div>

<p>"I guess he's hunting for little Timmy
Meadowmouse," answered Little Jack Rabbit.
"It will be bad luck for Timmy to be
caught."</p>

<p>"Why don't you run over and tell him,"
said Mrs. Rabbit. "Black Cat may be hiding
near his house. You'd better hurry."</p>

<p>So away hopped the little rabbit to find
Timmy Meadowmouse, who lived in a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
round house made of twisted grass on
the Sunny Meadow. Pretty soon he saw the
little meadowmouse peeking out of his front
door.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it, Little Jack Rabbit,"
he said with a sigh of relief, "I thought I
heard some one creeping around my house.
But if it was you, it's all right."</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't all right," answered the
little rabbit, and he told how his mother had
seen Black Cat cross the path from right to
left. "And that means bad luck, you know."</p>

<p>"If he crosses your path from left to right,
what does that mean?" asked the little meadowmouse.</p>

<p>"Good luck," answered Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Timmy Meadowmouse
with a shiver, "if he saw me first, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
would be bad luck no matter which way he
crossed the path."</p>

<p>Just then Little Jack Rabbit saw something
move in the tall grass. "Look out,"
he shouted.</p>

<p>Into his house popped Timmy Meadowmouse,
and none too soon, for Black Cat
landed on the very spot where he had stood
talking to the little rabbit.</p>

<p>"So it was you who warned Timmy
Meadowmouse, was it?" he hissed, humping
up his back and waving his long tail
back and forth. Oh my, but he looked
ugly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was I," answered Little Jack
Rabbit bravely, and then he did what his
mother had taught him to do when in a
tight place. He suddenly turned his back
on Black Cat and struck out with his strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hind legs. Thump! they went against
Black Cat's ribs, knocking him over. Then
away hopped the little rabbit back to the
Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<div class='poem'>
If you do what mother says<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll grow tall and strong.</span><br />
On your lips a happy smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In your heart a song&mdash;</span><br />
If you do what mother says<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You will not go wrong.</span><br />

<h2>LITTLE JACK RABBIT STUBS HIS TOE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Cocky Doodle</span> stood by the Big Red Barn
and clapped his wings. Then digging his
feet well into the ground, he began his
morning cock-a-doodle-do.</div>

<p>Mr. Merry Sun lifted his head from his
crimson pillows and looked over the misty
hilltop.</p>

<p>"Time for me to get up," he yawned.
"Cocky Doodle is calling."</p>

<p>Teddy Turtle crawled along the Old
Cow Path to the Old Duck Pond. He
didn't see Little Jack Rabbit hopping over
the grass. Teddy is so slow that he never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
thinks any one can go faster. So it was only
when the little rabbit stubbed his toe on
the little turtle's hard shell house that he
woke up. Of course he wasn't really asleep,
but he might just as well have been.</p>

<p>"You ought to know better than to go to
sleep right in the Old Cow Path," said the
little bunny, rubbing his toe. "Why don't
you keep your head out to see where you're
going if you walk in your sleep?"</p>

<p>"I pulled my head inside my shell when
you hit me, as all well-trained turtles do in
time of danger," answered Teddy Turtle.</p>

<p>"Goodness, I wouldn't be afraid of anything
if I had a strong shell house like yours
to creep into."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not afraid of anybody except
the Miller's Boy," said Teddy Turtle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
"But when he turns me over on my back I'm
helpless."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked the little
rabbit.</p>

<p>"Down to the Old Duck Pond. I'm going
to sleep in the soft mud for the winter,"
answered Teddy Turtle.</p>

<p>"Well, goodby," said the little rabbit,
hopping off to the Old Farm Yard.</p>

<p>"Cock-a-doodle-do," sang Cocky Doodle.
"I hope everybody is awake. There comes
Mr. Merry Sun up the sky. Cock-a-doodle-do.
Everybody gets up when I call.
Don't you hear Billy Breeze singing over
the Sunny Meadow? I wake the Little People
of the Shady Forest and the Sunny
Meadow every morning. Cock-a-doodle-do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, sir. This little rooster was better than
an alarm clock, for you didn't have to wind
him. He crowed every morning his cheerful
song to help the old world wag along.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h2>MUD TURTLE TOWN</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Mud Turtles were having a fine time
on the banks of the Old Duck Pond. What
is more fun I should like to know than making
mud pies and forts, and these little turtles
had been busy for several days until
they had built a mud city, with bridges and
houses, towers and castles.</div>

<p>Goodness me! It was muddy, and the
Farmyard Folk were all complaining, except
Ducky Waddles. He just loved mud,
and found it great fun waddling over
the mud bridges. And if they broke
down, he didn't mind a muddy splashing!
No, indeed he didn't. So, of course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
he and the Mud Turtles were great friends.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Merry Sun, seeing how
things were going on, said to himself: "I
guess I'll dry up all the Turtle Mud
Houses." So he set to work, shining down
from the bright blue sky, and before evening
the mud palaces and castles were hard
as bricks.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he said, just before he went to
sleep on the crimson pillows of the West,
"I've finished Mud Turtle Town!"</p>

<p>Of course, all this was more or less of an
accident, for the Mud Turtles hadn't asked
Mr. Merry Sun to help them. But when
they saw what he had done, they were delighted,
and at once sent out invitations to
all the Barnyard Folk to spend a week in
Turtle Town.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Cocky Doodle and Henny Penny accepted
at once; so did Goosey Lucy; and as
soon as they had packed their things, they
set out for the Old Duck Pond.</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall lay an egg while
I'm there," said Henny Penny&mdash;"I'm not
used to Mud Nests."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," said Cocky Doodle.</p>

<p>"Henny Penny is right," said Goosey
Lucy. "It will be a little vacation for us.
I, for one, shall be glad to forget all about
home duties."</p>

<p>Just then there was a great flapping of
wings and Ducky Waddles came wabbling
after them. "Why don't you wait for a
fellow," he panted. "I'm all out of breath
trying to catch up to you. I almost had to
fly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>As they crossed the Old Cow Path they
met Little Jack Rabbit hopping home to the
Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>"We're going to make a visit in Turtle
Town," said Henny Penny. "Why don't
you come, too?"</p>

<p>"Haven't time," answered the little bunny.
"Mother sent me over to Cousin Cottontail
for lollypop frosting. She must have it in
time to cover the carrot cake for supper."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<h2>BOBBY TAIL</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Mr. John Rabbit</span> had been a great jumper
in his youth, and Little Jack Rabbit wished
to learn to jump as far as his father, and
even farther.</div>

<p>So every day he practiced jumping in the
Sweet Clover Field near the Old Rail Fence
until by and by he could jump over the second
rail.</p>

<p>"Pretty good," said Mr. Rabbit. "Don't
believe I did any better when I was your
age. How is Bobby Tail getting along?"</p>

<p>Now Little Jack Rabbit's brother was
called Bobby Tail, because his tail was so
short. Yes, siree, it was so short that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
looked exactly like a white powder puff.
And his eyes were just like little pink beads.
But they weren't any pinker than his nose.</p>

<p>But, I'm sorry to say, there was something
wrong with Bobby Tail. He was too
lazy for anything. That was what was the
matter with him. He didn't want to learn
to jump&mdash;he'd rather spend his time eating
clover tops. By and by he grew to be dreadfully
fat.</p>

<p>And a fat bunny can't run fast nor jump
far. Bobby Tail found this to be true when
one day Sic'em, the Farmer's Dog, chased
him across the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>The Bunny Brothers had hopped down
to the Old Duck Pond to see Granddaddy
Bullfrog, when all of a sudden Sic'em saw
them. Goodness me! What a chase he gave
them! Over the Sunny Meadow, through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the Shady Forest, and along the Old Rail
Fence! At first Bobby Tail was able to
keep up with brother, but after a while he
fell behind.</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" shouted Little Jack Rabbit.
But, Oh dear me! Bobby Tail was so fat
and so short of breath that he couldn't.
Closer and closer came Sic'em till the little
bunny could almost feel his hot breath.</p>

<p>"If I ever get back to the Old Bramble
Patch," he thought, "I'll practice running
and jumping every day in the week."</p>

<p>Just then, he reached the Old Rail Fence.
Another jump landed him in the dear Old
Bramble Patch, leaving Sic'em barking
and growling outside the prickly bushes.</p>

<p>"You've had a narrow escape," said Mr.
Rabbit, looking up over his evening paper,
"I hope it will teach you a lesson!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>And it did. The very next day Bobby
Tail practiced jumping with Little Jack
Rabbit, and kept it up until he became almost
as good a jumper as his brother.</p>

<p>But Old Sic'em never knew how this
came to pass. He was too busy keeping
watch over the Old Farmyard to bother his
head about Bobby Tail, for Danny Fox,
who was always prowling around, hunting
for a stray chicken, kept the old dog forever
on the lookout.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2>SUNSHINE</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Where</span> did you get your red coat?" asked
Little Jack Rabbit, looking up from the Old
Bramble Patch.</div>

<p>"Oh, that's my secret," answered Red
Bird from the Old Rail Fence. "There's
been a legend in our family about it ever
since the Flood."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," exclaimed the little
rabbit.</p>

<p>"You've heard of the Great Flood, I suppose,
that happened hundreds and hundreds
of years ago?"</p>

<p>Little Jack Rabbit nodded. "I hope we
don't get another to wash away the Old
Bramble Patch."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," continued Red Bird, "the legend
is that one day, after it had been raining
ever so long, when there was nothing but
water all around and everybody in the ark
was feeling very miserable, Mother Noah
wrung her hands and said, 'Oh, dear! We'll
all be lost. We'll never get ashore!'</p>

<p>"Just then my ancestor began to whistle,
and the next minute a beam of sunshine
broke through the clouds and settled upon
him.</p>

<p>"'My dear, we are reproved,' said Father
Noah. 'The little bird has more courage
than we have. Hear him whistle.'</p>

<p>"Then everybody turned to look at the
brave little whistler. He was so embarrassed
that he BLUSHED&mdash;we were gray
before that time, they say&mdash;blushed so very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
deeply that our feathers have never lost
their bright red from that day to this."</p>

<p>"Well, well," exclaimed the little rabbit.
"When do you go away for the winter?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going away&mdash;I'm going to stay
right here," answered Red Bird.</p>

<p>"You'll find it pretty breezy up there,"
said Little Jack Rabbit with a twinkle of his
pink nose.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I've got on my
double-breasted red coat."</p>

<p>"But what will you find to eat when the
berries are all gone?" asked the little rabbit.</p>

<p>"I'll pick up crumbs at the Old Farm
House," replied Red Bird cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You've got a sunshiny disposition," said
Little Jack Rabbit admiringly. "I guess
your ancestors handed down something besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a red coat&mdash;some of that sunshine that
turned his feathers red must have crept into
his heart."</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Red Bird.</p>

<p>"Maybe it doesn't make much difference
how you got it, as long as you keep it," said
the little bunny as he hopped back into the
Old Bramble Patch to tell his mother all
about it.</p>

<h2>TURKEY TIM</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Turkey Tim</span> in his turban-colored comb
strutted about the Old Farmyard, spreading
his tail like a Japanese fan to the bright
light that Mr. Merry Sun sent down from
the Big Blue Sky.</div>

<p>"I wonder what makes Turkey Tim so
proud?" asked Henny Penny.</p>

<p>Little Jack Rabbit wiggled his pink nose,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Is it because the Kind Farmer is buying
chestnuts for him from Chippy Chipmunk?"</p>

<p>Still the little rabbit made no reply.</p>

<p>"Please tell me," begged Henny Penny.
"You can whisper in my ear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Turkey Tim thinks the Kind Farmer
is fond of him, but that's not the reason,"
answered the little rabbit.</p>

<p>"What is the reason?" asked Henny
Penny, who you see by this time was a very
curious little hen.</p>

<p>"Turkey Tim wouldn't believe me if I
told him," said the little rabbit.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't he?" exclaimed the little hen,
her feathers ruffled with excitement and
curiosity.</p>

<p>"It's a big secret," whispered the little
bunny.</p>

<p>"Tell me quick," coaxed Henny Penny.</p>

<p>"Thanksgiving!" whispered Little Jack
Rabbit. "Haven't you heard of chestnut-fed
turkeys for Thanksgiving?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean they are going to kill Turkey
Tim?" cried the little hen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I certainly do," answered the little rabbit.
"But he's so proud he wouldn't believe
me. Why, he thinks he's more wonderful
than Cocky Doodle."</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't," said Henny Penny.
"Cocky Doodle's the most wonderful of all
the Feathered Folk, for he's the one who
wakes up Mr. Merry Sun. Cocky Doodle
is the cock-a-doodle-do clock of the whole
wide world. Why, if it weren't for him
Mr. Merry Sun might stay in bed all
day."</p>

<p>Just then along came Turkey Tim, but
he didn't look so proud when the little hen
told him about Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"Who told you?" he asked in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>"Little Jack Rabbit," answered Henny
Penny, pointing to the truthful little bunny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess I'll make a visit in the Friendly
Forest," said Turkey Tim in a low voice,
and off he went as fast as his legs would
take him.</p>

<p>But, Oh dear me! No sooner was he
there than Billy Breeze began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Look out, look out for Danny Fox!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He sneaks about in his woolen socks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You never can tell where he is at,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For he creeps around like a tip-toe cat."</span><br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<h2>PHOEBE PHEASANT</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Little</span> Phoebe Pheasant's dew-wet feet
hurried along the edge of the Sunny Meadow.
Mr. Merry Sun hadn't been up long
enough to dry the grass, for it was very early
in the morning.</div>

<p>In some places the dew had turned to
frost, but the little pheasant didn't mind
that in the least, for she is a hardy bird, and
not a bit afraid of cold weather.</p>

<p>The weather is about the only thing she
isn't afraid of, for she is very timid. Although
she sometimes went to the Old
Farmyard for breakfast, at the slightest
noise she would fly away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>As she hurried along through the dewy
frost she caught sight of Little Jack Rabbit.
And as he was the one person she
wished to see that morning, it didn't take her
long to reach the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Phoebe Pheasant," said
the little bunny. "You seem in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm in a dreadful hurry to ask you
something," replied the little pheasant.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" laughed the little
bunny.</p>

<p>"You remember Turkey Tim left the Old
Farmyard before Thanksgiving?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," answered the little rabbit.</p>

<p>"He wants to know whether the Kind
Farmer has been looking for him?" whispered
Phoebe Pheasant. "He doesn't dare
go back himself to find out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should say not," answered the little
rabbit. "The Kind Farmer's dreadfully put
out. He had to go without his Thanksgiving
turkey!"</p>

<p>"Then you think it would be dangerous
for Turkey Tim to go back to the Old
Farmyard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just now," replied the little bunny.
"He'd better wait until everybody has forgotten
Thanksgiving."</p>

<p>"It's dreadfully hard on him, all alone
in the Shady Forest," sighed the little pheasant.
"He's not a Wild Turkey, you know."</p>

<p>"Never mind if he isn't," answered Little
Jack Rabbit. "He'll be a Roast Turkey if
he goes back now to the Old Farmyard."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SNOWBALL</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Billy Breeze</span> had kicked up an awful
racket all night around the Old Briar Patch,
but Little Jack Rabbit hadn't heard him.
No, sir. The little bunny had been too
sound asleep to hear anything, but when he
looked out in the morning, goodness me!
how he shivered.</div>

<p>The ground was all covered with a white
mantle, but he didn't know it was snow.
This was the first snow he had ever seen.
It made everything look strange, and the
ground was as smooth as Mrs. Rabbit's best
linen tablecloth.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he hopped down to the Bubbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Brook, but it, too, had changed. It
was smooth, like glass. So the little rabbit
leaned over the bank to listen, but just then
Billy Breeze made a dreadful racket and
whirled the snow about in great clouds. But
the little rabbit didn't care; he just kept
on listening, and by and by he heard the
Bubbling Brook singing softly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Underneath the ice and snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Very gently still I flow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till I reach the Old Duck Pond</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the ocean far beyond.</span><br />
<br />
"Billy Breeze may whistle loud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Toss the snow up in a cloud,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Underneath the ice and snow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Very gently still I flow."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Dear me," said the little rabbit to himself,
"I never would know that this was the
Old Duck Pond if it weren't for the Old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Mill yonder. No wonder Granddaddy
Bullfrog hid himself deep down in the mud
before all this happened."</p>

<p>Yes, the whole earth seemed quiet and
still. The mill wheel moved no more; great
icicles hung from the paddles and long
snowdrifts lay piled against the dam.</p>

<p>I don't know how long the little rabbit
would have stood there wondering at the
sudden change if something hadn't happened.
Whiz! went a snowball past his
ear. The Farmer's Boy leaned over and
picked up some more snow. But the little
rabbit didn't wait to see what sort of a
snowball he would make this time. No,
siree. He hopped back to the dear Old
Bramble Patch as fast as he could.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE NEW SLEIGH</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Old Farm Yard was a very comfortable
sort of a place. Little Jack Rabbit
liked to go there, for all the Barnyard Folk
were very nice to him, especially Henny
Penny and Cocky Doodle, who always gave
him some of their corn.</div>

<p>Then, too, it was great fun playing about
the High Haystack. Here they all gathered
after a snow storm, for the snow soon melted
on the sunny side.</p>

<p>Another reason, too, why the little rabbit
came so often was because many of his
friends were tucked away for a long winter's
nap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Busy Beaver was safe in his little house
under the ice in the Forest Pool. Squirrel
Nutcracker and his family came out only
on warm, sunshiny days. The rest of the
time they spent sleeping in their warm little
houses. As for Granddaddy Bullfrog, he
never showed up&mdash;he was sound asleep in
the soft mud at the bottom of the Old Duck
Pond.</p>

<p>The little rabbit's mother had told him
not to go too often to the Old Farm Yard
for fear the Kind Farmer might not like it.
"Henny Penny and Cocky Doodle are your
friends," she told him, "but I'm not so sure
about Mr. Farmer."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right, mother," answered the
little rabbit. "He's very kind. He feeds
all the Barn Yard Folk with such nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
food. I'm sure he's very good and kind."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure," answered the little
rabbit's mother, with a knowing wag of her
head.</p>

<p>One day when the little bunny hopped
into the Old Farm Yard he heard Cocky
Doodle say:</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful sleigh!" And just as Little
Jack Rabbit was going to ask what he
meant, the Kind Farmer came out of the
Big Red Barn with Betsy, the Old Gray
Mare, and hitched her up to a beautiful
dark green sleigh.</p>

<p>"Git ap!" he said, snapping the whip over
her back.</p>

<p>"Oh, Oh!" cried the little rabbit, "Maybe
mother is right. I guess he's not such
a kind farmer after all!" But of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the little bunny didn't know that the
Kind Farmer hardly touched Old Betsy,
although the whip made a loud crack and
she threw out her heels and ran off at a
great rate.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the nice new sleigh.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh what fun it is to run!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sang dear Old Betsy Gray.</span><br />
</div>

<h2>DAILY DUTIES</h2>

<div class='poem'>
It isn't always easy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To do the things you must.</span><br />
Some people if they stay at home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say they will surely rust.</span><br />
But you will find the longer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You live from day to day</span><br />

</div>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, dear!" sighed Little Jack Rabbit one
lovely spring morning, "I'm so tired of polishing
this doorknob every day and every
day. I wish it would drop off."</div>

<p>"Goodness me, little rabbit," said Grandmother
Magpie, who just then happened
along, "you are a disagreeable bunny boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
this morning." And the old lady magpie
looked at him out of her little black eyes as
much as to say: "I wish I had that bunny
boy to bring up, I'd make him toe the
mark."</p>

<p>And perhaps she would, and perhaps she
wouldn't, for some people can bring up
other people's children ever so much better
than their own, or even themselves. Isn't
that strange? Well, maybe it is and maybe
it isn't.</p>

<p>"What are you saying to my little bunny
boy?" asked Mrs. John Rabbit, putting her
head out of the kitchen window and scowling
at Grandmother Magpie.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much," said that meddlesome
old lady bird.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better not," said Mrs. Rabbit.
"It's all you can do to gossip about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
grown-up people's affairs." And then Mrs.
Rabbit shook her dusting rag up and down,
and maybe once sideways, and after that she
shut the window. So Grandmother Magpie
flew away without another word.</p>

<p>"I'm glad she's gone," said the little rabbit
to himself, and just then Bobbie Redvest
began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Every day a little work,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Every day a song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Every day a kindly word</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Helps us all along."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And after that he picked up a crumb and
said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, little rabbit. Don't forget
to feed the canary."</p>

<p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed the little
bunny, "I almost forgot!" And wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it have been dreadful if he had, for little
Miss Canary couldn't get out of her gold
cage and look for worms like all the wild
birds can, you know.</p>

<p>Well, when the little rabbit had finished
his work, he hopped out to the Sunny
Meadow where Mr. Merry Sun was making
the buttercups grow more yellow every day,
and the daisies whiter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<h2>MRS. ORIOLE'S MIRROR</h2>

<div class='poem'>
Oh, Mrs. Cow has a little bell<br />
Tied to her neck with a string,<br />
And every time she shakes her head<br />
It gives a ting-a-ling-ling.<br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Helloa</span>, little rabbit," said Ducky Waddles.
"I guess I'll go down to the Old Duck
Pond and take a swim." So off he went,
wabbly, wabbly, on his big yellow feet, and
pretty soon he saw Granddaddy Bullfrog
on his log. The old gentleman frog was
feeling very fine this lovely spring morning,
for he had just eaten thirty-three flies, and
that's a pretty good breakfast, let me tell
you, even if the advertisements say you must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
eat shavings and cream to be perfectly
well.</div>

<p>"Good morning, Ducky Waddles," said
Granddaddy Bullfrog. "Have you heard
the news?"</p>

<p>"What news?" asked Ducky Waddles,
taking off his collar and his blue necktie before
jumping into the water.</p>

<p>"Why, the Farmer's Boy has gone to the
city to see his old maid aunt," said Granddaddy
Bullfrog with a grin. "He won't
throw stones at me now for maybe a week."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good news," said Ducky
Waddles. "Now I can take a swim without
worrying about my new necktie." And he
flopped into the water with a splash that
almost frightened to death a little tadpole
who was swimming close by.</p>

<p>"Gracious me!" said the Little Tadpole,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
whose name was Tad, "if that old duck had
seen me he would have gobbled me up as
quick as a winkerty blinkerty." And then
he hid behind a water lily stem until
Ducky Waddles was far away.</p>

<p>Well, Ducky Waddles hadn't gone very
far before Mrs. Oriole, who had a nest like
a long white stocking on a branch of the
weeping willow tree, began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Swing high, swing low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Swing to and fro</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From the branch of the willow tree.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But whenever I look</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the Bubbling Brook</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Another bird looks at me."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Professor Jim Crow,
who happened to come by just then. "What
sort of a bird lives in the Bubbling Brook?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you one thing," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Mrs. Oriole, "she doesn't keep her feathers
well combed."</p>

<p>And then you should have heard that
wise old blackbird laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, when you look in the Bubbling
Brook again," he said, "comb your feathers,
Mrs. Oriole, and perhaps that other bird
will do the same."</p>

<p>And would you believe it, that's just what
happened? But how Professor Jim Crow
knew it I'm sure I don't know, unless his
wife had a vanity bag with a little mirror
in it, as all the ladies do nowadays who don't
vote, I'm told.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<h2>AN AIRSHIP RIDE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Well</span>, all of a sudden, as Mrs. Oriole
combed her yellow curls&mdash;beg pardon, I
mean feathers&mdash;Little Jack Rabbit heard
a voice say, quite close to his ear, "Hello!"
And when he looked around he saw his
friend the Jay Bird perched on a bramble
branch.</div>

<p>"How did you get here?" asked the little
rabbit.</p>

<p>"In my airship," replied the little bird.
"Don't you want to take a ride?"</p>

<p>"Will you wait till I finish cleaning my
gold watch?" and the little rabbit set to
work, and before long he could see his face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in it and the Jay Bird's too, for Mr. Merry
Sun made that little gold watch shine like
a ball of fire.</p>

<p>Then away went the little rabbit and the
Jay Bird, and pretty soon they were flying
over the Sunny Meadow, over the treetops
and over the steeples, and over the houses
and over the peoples!</p>

<p>Well, sir, it wasn't very long before they
were far, far away from the Shady Forest,
and then the little rabbit said: "Don't go
too far, Mr. Jay Bird, for mother will worry
if I don't get home in time for supper." And
just then up came the American Eagle with
a big flag in his beak and seven silver stars
on the tips of his tail feathers.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O come with me and I'll show you where<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I've a nest on the mountain high in the air;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It's a lonely place, but it's home for me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With Mrs. Eagle and children three."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Show us the way and we'll follow," said
the Jay Bird, and he steered his airship after
the great American Eagle, and by and by
they came to his nest high up on the mountain's
rocky crest.</p>

<p>The little rabbit hopped out and went
over to say how do you do to the little eaglets,
and when they showed him their Thrift
Stamp Books, what do you think this generous
little rabbit did? Why, he opened his
knapsack and gave them each a War Saving
Stamp. Wasn't that kind of him?</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Eagle went to the ice box for
ice cream cones, and everybody had a feast,
and after that the Jay Bird said it was time
to go. So he and the little rabbit got into the
airship and went away, and by and by they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
were just above the Bramble Patch. Mrs.
Rabbit was looking out of the window, and
as soon as she saw them way up high in the
clear blue sky, she rang the supper bell, and
Cocky Doodle sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Home again, my little rabbit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That's the place to be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Only there true love and rest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Waits for you and me."</span><br />
